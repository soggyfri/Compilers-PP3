      This is an example of text that 
would be transformed into a paragraph in
 latex. Blank lines between text in the 
input cause a new paragraph to be genera
ted. This is an example of text that wou
ld be transformed into a paragraph in la
tex. Blank lines between text in the inp
ut cause a new paragraph to be generated
. This is an example of text that would 
be transformed into a paragraph in latex
. Blank lines between text in the input 
cause a new paragraph to be generated. W
hen the blank line occurs after a sectio
n, no indentation of the paragraph is pe
rformed. However, all other blanks, woul
d result in a five space indent of the p
aragraph. When the blank line occurs aft
er a section, no indentation of the para
graph is performed. However, all other b
lanks, would result in a five space inde
nt of the paragraph. 



     Now, its important to make sure
 that single works correctly, and can be
 used to change the formating with respe
ct to the ways lines are output. In this
 case, we are going from double to singl
e spacing.

1.2 Legal Latex Commands

      We have seen that there are 
many different Latex commands, that can

be used in many different ways. However,
 sometimes, we wish to use a character t
o mean itself, and override its Latex in
terpretation. For example, to use curly 
braces, we employ the backslash a set of
 integers. 



1.3 Again Legal Latex Commands

 sometimes, we wish to use a character t

1.4 Yet Some More Legal Latex Commands

     

     We have see

mmands, that can be used in many differe

use a character to mean itself, and over
ride its Latex interpretation. For examp
le, to use curly braces, we employ the b
ackslash a set of integers.

 begin end blocks, that establish an env
ironment. These blocks behave in a simil
ar fashion to begin end blocks in a prog
ramming language, since they set a scope

 The project for the Spring 1994 Semeste
r will focus on the design and implement
ation of a Latex subset for text process
ing. Specifically, this project will be 
subdivided into three major parts.
1. Design and develop a contex free gram
  mar CFG for a subset of Latex.
2. Design, implement, and test the commo
  n CFG which I will provide to you at a 
  later date using Lex Flex and Yacc Biso
  n .
3. Design, implement, and test a syntax 
  directed translator based on part 2 tha
  t automatically generates formatted ASC
  II text from an input Latex source file
  .

The first part of the project is divided
into two major tasks.
-  Design a CFG for the project that allo
   ws Latex programs e.g., text to be fo
   rmatted to be recognized. This will p
   rovide you with important language de
   sign experience.
-  Calculate FIRST and FOLLOW for the non
   terminals listed below

latex   statement      main   body      
    main   option        text   option la
tex   options        backs   options     
 begin   end   opts     begin   block beg
in   end   cmds       table   options    
 


Neither of these tasks require you to de
velop and or implement code. <IT>This is
a design project!!!</IT> The first part 
of the project is worth 50 points.

r project, a detailed overview of the La
tex subset that youll be implementing ha

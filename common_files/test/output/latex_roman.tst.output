 This is an example of text that would b

Blank lines between text in the input ca

use a new paragraph to be generated. Thi

an example of text that would be transfo

ank line occurs after a section, no inde

ntation of the paragraph is performed. H

owever, all other blanks, would result i

n a five space indent of the paragraph. 

When the blank line occurs after a secti

on, no indentation of the paragraph is p

erformed. However, all other blanks, wou

ld result in a five space indent of the 

paragraph. 




Now, its important to make sure that sin
gle works correctly, and can be used to 
change the formating with respect to the
ways lines are output. In this case, we 
are going from double to single spacing.

1.2 Legal Latex Commands

 We have seen that there are many differ

ent Latex commands, that can be used in 

many different ways. However, sometimes,

we wish to use a character to mean itsel

f, and override its Latex interpretation

. For example, to use curly braces, we e

mploy the backslash a set of integers.

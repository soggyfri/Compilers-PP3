A text processor is
a very useful  tool, since it allows us to
develop  formatted documents

\subsection{Legal Latex Commands}

We have seen that there are many different Latex commands, that can be used
in many different ways.  However, sometimes, we wish to use a character to
mean itself, and override its Latex interpretation.  For example, to use
curly braces, we employ the backslash a set of integers.

\subsection{Again Legal Latex Commands}

We have seen that there are many different Latex commands, that can be used
in many different ways.  However, sometimes, we wish to use a character to
mean itself, and override its Latex interpretation.  For example, to use
curly braces, we employ the backslash a set of integers.

\subsection{Yet Some More Legal Latex Commands}

\section{Using Latex}

Finally, there are {\it many other useful} commands that involve begin end blocks,
that establish an environment. These blocks behave in a similar fashion to
begin end blocks in a programming language, since they set a scope.  We
have discussed a number of examples.

\it
It is important to note, even at this early stage, that lists may be created
within lists, allowing the nesting of blocks and environments.

\subsection{Check this Out}

Finally, there are  commands that involve begin end blocks,
that establish an environment. These blocks behave in a similar fashion to

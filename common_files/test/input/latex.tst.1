\section{Introduction}
A text processor is
a very useful  tool, since it allows us to
develop  formatted documents 
\it
that are easy to read.

\subsection{Legal Latex Commands}
\rm
We have seen that there are many different Latex commands, that can be used
in many different ways.  However, sometimes, we wish to use a character to
mean itself, and override its Latex interpretation.  For example, to use
curly braces, we employ the backslash a set of integers.

Can we have different paragraphs with the current generate_formatted_text
function?

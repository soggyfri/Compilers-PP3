\section{Introduction}

This is an example of text that would be transformed into a paragraph in
latex.  Blank lines between text in the input cause a new paragraph to be 
generated.  

When the blank line occurs after a section, no indentation of the paragraph
is performed.  However, all other blanks, would result in a five space 
indent of the paragraph.

\subsection{A Text Processor}

A text processor is a very useful tool, since it allows us to
develop formatted documents that are easy to read.

\subsection{Legal Latex Commands}

We have seen that there are many different Latex commands, that can be used
in many different ways.  However, sometimes, we wish to use a character to
mean itself, and override its Latex interpretation.  For example, to use
curly braces, we employ the backslash a set of integers.

\section{Using Latex}

\it
Finally, there are many other useful commands that involve begin/end blocks,
that establish an environment. These blocks behave in a similar fashion to
begin/end blocks in a programming language, since they set a scope.  We
have discussed a number of examples.
\rm
It is important to note, even at this early stage, that lists may be created
within lists, allowing the nesting of blocks and environments.
